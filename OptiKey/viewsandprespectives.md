# Views and prespectives 

## OptiKey Fork

* [OptiKey Fork](https://github.com/adirel/OptiKey) - this is our fork to the OptiKey project
* [OptiKey Fork - Modeling documentation folder](https://github.com/adirel/OptiKey/tree/master/docs/Modeling) - we created a new modeling folder into the OptiKey project in our fork.

## Documentation and general source code structure is as follows

* OptiKey project includes a "docs" folder which contains general information such as credits, graphic design notes and some of the deployment proccess of the project.
* [OptiKey wiki](https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey/wiki) - contain a full user guide about the UI, general information, technical support, troubleshooting and installation proccess.
* [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLkyORh7vKk) - there is an intro video which is very helpfull.
* general source code structure - is a typicaly .Net formation project of WPF architecture. this is a very importent part which called "enums" and its decribe major part of the system code structure.
 general formation appears to be divided into external tools and main source code (divided by two folders) . inside the source code folder we can detect its seperated into three main areas - Main Source, Unit tests and Auto Complete Performance which is another user test cases and automaticly unit testing focus on performance.

## Analysis and description of the major & important designs with UML diagrams and other modelling means

One of the most important stages which represent a open source communinity is adding value and system expandad measures.
The following diagram describes the 4 stages which are needed to add a new locale.
* UI element translations
* word dictionary
* keyboard layout
* integration into OptiKey
